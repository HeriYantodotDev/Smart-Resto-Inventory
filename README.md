## August 17, 2023.

- Goal: Create a plan for Smart-Resto-Inventory Project
- Result: Initiate the project by setting it up, configuring linting and tests, and formulating a comprehensive plan for the application.
- Obstacles:
  - I have no idea how to test my React App with Firebase. Should I mock it? Or Using the emulator? I think I have to spend time to figure it out.
- **Updated** : ✅The previous obstacles have been cleared.
